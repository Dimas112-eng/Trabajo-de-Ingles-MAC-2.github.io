                <h3>Why Sleep Habits Matter</h3>

                <p>Sleeping well helps the body fight infections and stay healthy, as during sleep the body produces extra proteins that make the immune system stronger, especially in stressful situations.</p>

                <ol>
<li>Reduce stress

    During sleep, the body reduces the production of cortisol and adrenaline, which helps reduce stress.</li><br>
<li>Control your appetite

    Sleep helps regulate the hormones that affect and control appetite, so when you sleep poorly, these hormones become unregulated and the desire for foods rich in calories, fats and carbohydrates increases.</li><br>
<li>Improve mood

    A tired brain impairs the production of serotonin, a mood-regulating hormone, and also the immune system. People who sleep well at night are happier and in a better mood during the day. Furthermore, when poor sleep becomes a chronic problem, it can cause long-term mood disorders, such as depression or anxiety, for example.
    </li><br>
<li>Improve memory

    Sleeping well allows the brain to better process new experiences and knowledge. It is during sleep that recently acquired memories are transferred from the motor cortex to the temporal lobe, where they become "rooted" information that will be remembered in the long term. Therefore, poor sleep can mean that new information is not stored correctly.</li><br>
<li>Improve reasoning

    Poor sleep affects cognition, attention and decision making. That's why people who sleep poorly have greater difficulty solving logic or mathematics problems and tend to make mistakes such as keeping their keys in the refrigerator.</li><br>
<li>Rejuvenate the skin

    A good night's sleep helps to rejuvenate the skin, as it reduces wrinkles and expression lines at night, skin cells renew and rest and melatonin is produced, which helps prevent aging.</li><br>
<li>Help with the immune system

    Sleeping well helps the body fight infections and stay healthy, as during sleep the body produces extra proteins that make the immune system stronger, especially in stressful situations.</li>

                <h3>Consequences of Poor Sleep Habits</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Thus, a person in deprivation of sleep for many hours has more difficulties in doing things, concluding reasons, concentrating his attention, presenting difficulties in making decisions and poorer performance at work or in school, for example.Some of the most common consequences are: 
                <ol>

                    <li>Risk of diseases: Chronic illness can lead to diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Lack of sound can also increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack and stroke. </li><br>

                    <li>Weight gain: Lack of sleep can lead to weight gain. When you fall asleep little, the body tries to compensate for the “lost night” by eating more caloric food.</li><br>

                    <li>Accidents: Lack of sound can increase the risk of work and traffic accidents.</li><br>

                    <li>Behavioral Alterations: Lack of sleep can cause behavioral alterations such as hyperactivity, impulsivity and aggression. </li><br>

                    <li>Hallucinations: In rarer cases, lack of sound can cause visual and auditory hallucinations.</li><br>
